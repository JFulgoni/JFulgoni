Hi, I'm John Fulgoni (@JFulgoni). I am a software developer originally from Long Island, NY currently living in the DC Area. 
I currently work at Mastercard as a Lead Software Engineer working on microservices using Java, SQL and Angular.
I graduated from Columbia University in 2016 with a Master of Science degree in Computer Science, 
and graduated Cum Laude from Villanova University in 2014 with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering. 

This is my personal Github account where I display my best graduate and undergraduate work, as well as side projects that I work on from time to time.
If you would like to reach out to me, please email me at jsf2154@columbia.edu.
